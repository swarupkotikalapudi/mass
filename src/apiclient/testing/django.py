        `MultiPartParser` is a curiously ugly and RFC non-compliant concoction.

        Amongst other things, it coerces all field names, field data, and
        filenames into Unicode strings using the "replace" error strategy, so
        be warned that your data may be silently mangled.

        It also, in 1.3.1 at least, does not recognise any transfer encodings
        at *all* because its header parsing code was broken.

        I'm also fairly sure that it'll fall over on headers than span more
        than one line.

        In short, it's a piece of code that inspires little confidence, yet we
        must work with it, hence we need to round-trip test multipart handling
        with it.
